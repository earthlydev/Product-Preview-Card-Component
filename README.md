## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

CSS Flexbox is something I am continuously learning. With this project I used Flexbox to align the two different sections in this project and this was the first time I used CSS Grid to make the product component mobile/desktop responsive. This is my first project using a mobile-first workflow.
